All data comes from the Kaya dataset found here: https://figshare.com/collections/A_large_electroencephalographic_motor_imagery_dataset_for_electroencephalographic_brain_computer_interfaces/3917698?q=5F .

These are 5F paradigms. The relevant marker states are as follows:
1. Thumb
2. Index finger
3. Middle finger
4. Ring finger
5. Pinkie finger
91. Session break
92. Experiment end
99. Initial relaxation

The data were collected at two sampling frequencies.
The datasets with HFREQ in the name were collected at 1000 Hz. All others were collected at 200 Hz.

The subdirectories are as follows:
	code: code for reading or processing the data
	fta: datasets preprocessed into FTA features. These are 21 channels [0, 0.85] relative to onset.
	raw: the original data as downloaded from the figshare collection. These are 22 channels (21 EEG, one synch).

NOTE: THE DATA ARE NOT CENTERED!
